## 📸 The Problem

Most online image compressors:
- ❌ Expose sensitive ID photos/signatures to privacy risks
- ❌ Offer inconsistent or lossy compression
- ❌ Lack DPI or physical (cm-based) dimension controls
- ❌ Require internet connectivity

**There's a clear need for a privacy-first, offline, and guided image optimization tool.**

## 💡 CM to PX Helper

Understanding the relationship between physical size (cm) and pixels:
```
Formula: pixels = (centimeters × DPI) / 2.54

Example at 300 DPI:
- 3.5 cm × 4.5 cm photo
- Width: (3.5 × 300) / 2.54 = 413 px
- Height: (4.5 × 300) / 2.54 = 531 px
```

The built-in converter does this math for you automatically!

## 🌟 Use Cases

### Passport Photos
- Set exact dimensions (e.g., 3.5cm × 4.5cm)
- Convert to pixels using 300 DPI
- Export as JPEG with specific file size

### Government Forms
- Meet strict size requirements (e.g., < 50KB)
- Maintain required DPI (often 200-300)
- Correct format (usually JPEG/JPG)

### Job Applications
- Professional photo compression
- Standard dimensions
- Optimal file size for email
